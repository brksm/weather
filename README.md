# TODO

* Read API docs and check we're using it in best way
* Show more information per tile (wind, humidity etc.)
* Webpack or Rollup instead of home-cooked Browserify scripts?
* Tests
* Nicer styling
* Minification

# CHECK

* Local time!
* Sometimes `npm install` fails
  - Need to try again


# MUETZE

* Move to webpack?
* Is Winston good logger?
* Is catw good for watching?
* React Hot Loader?
* Npm build script naming/ordering?
* Is protractor the right approach for testing react web apps?
  - Alternatives
  - Correct config for testing React apps with protractor
* At the moment need to run `webdriver-manager update` separately as manual build step :(
* Also need to start webdriver-manager separately before running front-end tests :(
* Should specify eslint to allow globals only in the right kind of files
* EditorConfig
* Is minifyify the right way?
  - Set up minifyify for production
* CSS build flow
* Semantic UI
  - Needs gulp globally?
  - Install into better directory?
  - Integrate gulp build step?
* Isomorphic JavaScript?
